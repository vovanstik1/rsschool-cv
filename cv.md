## About me:

I am a 27-year-old researcher with a Masterâ€™s degree and postgraduate studies completed at the Belarusian National Technical University (BNTU). Currently, I work as a Junior Research Fellow, where I have gained valuable experience in scientific research and analysis. Recently, I was tasked with developing a simple website for a scientific conference, which introduced me to the fundamentals of web development. This experience sparked my interest in programming and inspired me to pursue a career as a developer. Now, I am focused on building my skills in web development and software engineering to transition into a tech-focused role. I am driven, detail-oriented, and eager to apply my research background and newly acquired technical skills to create impactful digital solutions.
